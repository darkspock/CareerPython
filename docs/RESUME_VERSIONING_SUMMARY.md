## Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Hybrid Approach: Structured Data + PDF**

**Why both?**
- **Structured Data**: Primary view for in-app (searchable, filterable, better UX)
- **PDF**: Secondary for download (portable, legal snapshot, offline review)

**Benefits**:
- Best ATS experience for companies
- Compliance and audit trail
- Platform stickiness (structured data only in-app)
- Monetization opportunities

### 2. **Company Controls Update Policy**

Each Position has settings:
```python
allow_resume_updates: bool = False  # Default: no updates
resume_update_deadline_days: Optional[int] = 7  # e.g., 7 days
```

**Why?**
- Flexibility for companies (some want immutability, others want updates)
- Fair for candidates (can fix typos if allowed)
- Clear expectations set upfront

### 3. **Version History Maintained**

All resume versions are stored:
```python
resume_versions: List[ResumeVersion] = [
    {version: 1, pdf_url: "s3://...", created_at: "...", changelog: None},
    {version: 2, pdf_url: "s3://...", created_at: "...", changelog: "Added recent project"}
]
```

**Why?**
- Audit trail for compliance
- Companies can see what changed
- Candidates can track their updates
- Transparency

### 4. **Pseudo-Chat with Email Notifications**

**Flow**:
- Company sends message ‚Üí Email to candidate (notification only)
- Candidate clicks link ‚Üí Logs in ‚Üí Replies in-app
- NO email sent back to company

**Why?**
- Prevents email clutter
- Better conversation threading
- Centralized communication
- No spam/bounce issues
