# CQRS Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns implemented for the AI Resume
Enhancement Platform, following requirements 10.1 and 10.5.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Command/Query Separation (Requirement 10.1)

The system properly separates write operations (Commands) from read operations (Queries):

#### Commands (Write Operations)

- `UpgradeSubscriptionCommand` - Upgrades user subscription tiers
- `RecordUsageCommand` - Records usage events for subscription limits
- `ValidateSubscriptionActionCommand` - Validates subscription-based actions
- `GenerateResumePreviewCommand` - Generates resume previews

#### Queries (Read Operations)

- `GetSubscriptionStatusQuery` - Retrieves user subscription status and usage
- `GetUsageSummaryQuery` - Gets detailed usage summary for users
- `GetResumePreviewQuery` - Retrieves resume preview data
- `GetJobApplicationHistoryQuery` - Gets job application history

### 2. Domain Events (Requirement 10.5)

Domain events are properly implemented for cross-boundary communication:

#### Event Processing

- Events are dispatched through the existing `EventBus`
- Domain entities raise events that are processed after command execution
- Events enable loose coupling between bounded contexts

#### Key Events

- `SubscriptionUpgradedEvent` - When subscription is upgraded
- `ResumeDownloadedEvent` - When resume is downloaded
- `JobApplicationCreatedEvent` - When job application is created
- `UsageLimitExceededEvent` - When usage limits are exceeded

### 3. Architecture Compliance

#### Existing Infrastructure Used

- **Command Bus**: Uses existing `CommandBus` for command dispatch
- **Query Bus**: Uses existing `QueryBus` for query handling
- **Event Bus**: Uses existing `EventBus` for domain events
- **Container**: Handlers registered in existing DI container

#### CQRS Patterns Verified

- ✅ Commands are separate from Queries
- ✅ Command handlers perform write operations
- ✅ Query handlers perform read operations
- ✅ Domain events enable cross-boundary communication
- ✅ Dependency injection is used throughout
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns maintained

## Files Created

### Command Handlers

- `src/user/application/commands/upgrade_subscription.py`
- `src/user/application/commands/record_usage.py`
- `src/user/application/commands/validate_subscription_action.py`
- `src/candidate/application/commands/generate_resume_preview.py`

### Query Handlers

- `src/user/application/queries/get_subscription_status.py`
- `src/user/application/queries/get_usage_summary.py`
- `src/candidate/application/queries/get_resume_preview.py`
- `src/job_application/application/queries/get_job_application_history.py`

### Tests

- `tests/unit/shared/test_cqrs_patterns.py` - Verifies CQRS implementation

## Container Registration

New handlers are registered in `core/container.py`:

```python
# Command Handlers
upgrade_subscription_command_handler
record_usage_command_handler
validate_subscription_action_command_handler
generate_resume_preview_command_handler

# Query Handlers
get_subscription_status_query_handler
get_usage_summary_query_handler
get_resume_preview_query_handler
get_job_application_history_query_handler
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Execution

```python
command = UpgradeSubscriptionCommand(
    user_id="user123",
    new_tier="PREMIUM",
    payment_method_id="pm_123"
)
result = command_bus.dispatch(command)
```

### Query Execution

```python
query = GetSubscriptionStatusQuery(user_id="user123")
status = query_bus.query(query)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Commands and queries are clearly separated
2. **Scalability**: Read and write operations can be optimized independently
3. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between operations
4. **Event-Driven**: Domain events enable reactive programming
5. **Testability**: Each handler can be tested in isolation

## Compliance with Requirements

- **Requirement 10.1**: ✅ Commands and queries are properly separated
- **Requirement 10.5**: ✅ Domain events implemented for cross-boundary communication

The CQRS implementation leverages the existing architecture while adding the necessary patterns to support the AI Resume
Enhancement Platform's complex business requirements.
